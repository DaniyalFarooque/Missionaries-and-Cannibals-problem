The Missionaries and Cannibals problem illustrates the use of state space search for planning
under the following constraints:

Three missionaries and three cannibals, along with one boat that fits at most two people (and requires at least one for operation), are on the left bank of a river. The most salient thing about missionaries and cannibals in “cohabitation” is that if ever the cannibals in any one spot (left bank, right bank, on the boat) outnumber the missionaries, the outnumbered missionaries will be consumed – eaten! The goal of this problem is to get all six individuals safely across the river from the left bank to the right bank.
